# Reinforcement Learning Assignment: Easy21

A framework and an agent solving Easy21 for the Advanced Topics course (i.e., COMPM050/COMPGI13).

It supports both Monte Carlo and Sarsa(Î») to choose which one modify easy21.py accordingly:

`alg = MonteCarlo(N_0=100) #Monte Carlo`

or

`alg = SarsaL(N_0=100, gamma=1, lmbda = 0.5) #Sarsa`


Both approaches converge to similar solutions as seen in the figures below:
